Contains classes that extend from other parts of Eclipse such as SWT, JFace and the workbench
interfaces.  It is usefull to group them in this package because they are extensions that
help realize the GEF infrastructure but they are not explicitly part of the main hierarchies
with-in GEF.

<p>The example with-in this package is the <code>TextCellEditorEx which was extended from the
JFace implementation to allow for DirectEdit of name labels so that the first character
typed is not lost.</p>
